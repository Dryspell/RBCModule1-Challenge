# RBCModule1-Challenge

---

## Overview of Project
This project exemplifies a basic analysis on a dataset from the crowd-funding website **Kickstarter.com**. In this scenario, our client *Louise* is planning to raise money for several theatre productions and in doing so, would like to "game the system", that is, she would like to determine the best timing to start a fundraising campaign and the best amount of funds to request from the crowd. Here best is defined as *Likelihood of Success Based on Historical Trends*.

## Analysis and Challenges
Our results are centered upon two data fields: the launch date of the campaign and the amount of funds requested, known as the campaign's "goal". 

### Launch Date Correlation
As seen in the graph below, a great many campaigns were initiated in the month of May during the years of our dataset, however, this may be slightly deceiving in regards to success rates since we see the failure line of the graph nearly halfway between the success line and the x-axis throughout the graph.
